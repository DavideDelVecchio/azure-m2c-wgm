# MacOS Legacy Files

Due to the complexity of installing mongodb locally on macOS,
and setting system open-file limits, this project has abandoned the 
use of mongodb community edition installed with homebrew.
This used to be much simpler in recent years.

Instead, this project now uses mongodb running locally from a 
**Docker Container**.  See the following files in the parent directory:

- docker-compose.yml
- compose.sh
