# 08 - Edit the Mapping Files

Please see documentation page [07 - Generate Mapping Files](07_generate_mapping_files.md)
regarding the mapping file format and generation.

It is recommended that you generate these files with code rather than edit them
by hand, as they are verbose JSON files.

However, if you feed the need to edit these files, please see the previous page
regarding the format and content of these files.

Examples are here:

```
reference_app/data/metadata/olympics_mapping.json
reference_app/data/metadata/openflights_mapping.json
```

Once these mapping files are **finalized, or completed** please proceed to the
next pages, which uses the mapping files for **artifact generation**.
